# Introduction to Airtable API

This overiew displays the use of the Airtable API to communicate between an Airtable base table and a custom built website. Airtable is a web application that creates base apps, which are colorful, intuitive, easy-to-use spreadsheet sets. The base tables organize images, tags, descriptions, and much more. With the Airtable API, the user-freindly base apps provide a database admin that can be interacted from anywhere across the web.  

To proceed, create an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/) and select the example base named "Art Gallery". When finished, the browser displays a prefilled example table, pictured below.

Notice the name of the base app, Art Gallery, is displayed at the top center of the page. This base has two tables Artists and Collections. Artists is currently selected and open. In Artists, there are 19 example records or entries with the first 6 pictured above. There are several columns including Name, Attachments, and Bio. All of the table data has the ability to be updated with the Airtable API for outside applications.

A simple web application example pulls the data from the Artists table and displays the artists as a list on a public website, pictured below.
