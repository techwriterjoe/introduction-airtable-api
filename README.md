# Introduction to Airtable API

This overiew displays the use of the Airtable API to communicate between an Airtable base table and a custom built website. Airtable is a web application that creates base apps, which are colorful, intuitive, easy-to-use spreadsheet sets. The base tables organize images, tags, descriptions, and much more. With the Airtable API, the user-freindly base apps provide a database admin that can be interacted from anywhere across the web.  

To proceed, create an [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/) and select the example base named "Art Gallery". When finished, the browser displays a prefilled example table, pictured below.
